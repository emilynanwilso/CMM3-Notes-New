#22/23 question 2(d)
#Stability - behavious of method in preserving accruacy of solution over time. To avoid erratic and uncontrolled growth of data

#Explicit Euler Methods
"limited by stability considerations (e.g a large h will cause solution to oscillate or diverge from true solutions
"must usea smaller h to ensure stability

#Implicit Euler Methods
"unconditoonally stable, allowas larger step size, but requires more iterative methods"
