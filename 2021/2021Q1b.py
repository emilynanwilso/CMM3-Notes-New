method is:
    
integrate in sympy, then sub in values into integral.

The work done on an object is given by the integral of the force with respect to 
displacement. In the case of a spring, the force exerted by the spring is proportional
to the displacement. The equation for the force exerted by the spring is given by Hooke's Law:

F(t)= −k⋅x(t)

where 
k is the spring constant. In your case, 

x(t)=A⋅e(w_rt)*cos(w_i*t+phi)

so the force is:

F(t)= −k⋅A⋅e(w_rt)*cos(w_i*t+phi)
Now, the work done is the integral of the force with respect to displacement over the specified time interval. The work 

W is given by:

W = int(0,10) F(t).dx

Using the given values, we can calculate this integral to find the work done.
